For a lot of people spring marks a time of newness. The real start of the year
brings with it the flowering of daffodils, the birth of then lamb, the regrowth
of dead winter trees. With this newness comes a fresh start, a time to prepare 
and build a foundation for the new year ahead.

For these reason I saw this as a fitting time to finally get my act together, 
set aside some time and finish v2.0.0 of my website, including a blog, with the
purpose to document a bit about development and my life as a developer.

For those interested the website is built with a combination of
[Jekyll][jekyll-website] and [Gulp][gulp-website] and hosted on
[Digital Ocean][digital-ocean-referal]. If you curious to delve deeper under the
hood you can checkout the [Github repository][github-repo] and if you spot and 
problems please submit an [issue][github-repo-issues].
